description - The rank's description in /info ranks. \
permissions - Sets permissions that rank will have. Permission list: \
{perm-list} \
quests - This property determines how that rank will be obtained. Every quest uses properties. For example, \
this: [stat]"quests":{"deaths":{best:10,required:100}}[], would require the player to die at least 100 times, and \
only 10 players who died the most will have the rank. \
Another example: "quests":{"buildingsBuilt":{required:100, frequency:10}}, would mean that the player has to  \
build at least 100 buildings, and that the player must have at least 10x more buildings built than the amount of \
hours he played, so if you built 10 buildings every hour you will have the rank. Any less and that rank will be removed. \
[stat]More examples:[] "quests":{"buildingsBroken":{best:10},"playtime":{required:1000 * 60 * 60 * 100}}; \
"quests":{"messageCount":{"frequency":100,"bets":3,"required":10000}}. \
List of available stats: \
{stats} \
If you still don't understand this system, open an issue on github. \
linked - If you already defined a quest in a rank and want to use them in another, this property can be used. Lets say \
you defined bulldozer and kamikaze rank and want to combine their requirements into one rank's requirements. That rank \
would need to have "linked":["kamikaze","bulldozer"] as its property. That rank will be unobtainable if a nonexistent \
rank is linked to. \
pets - Pets are defined as a JSON array: "pets":["foo","bar"]. This array will spawn 2 pets attracted to the \
player. If the pets "foo" or "bar" don't exist, this won't work and you will get an error whenever a player with that \
rank joins. \
value - The priority value decides which rank should be rendered first.
